# 1) Could have used permutation instead of combination to not need to traverse in both directions.
# 2) should have still stuck with {(x,y): val} for my map and then used map.values() to iterate and list comprehension to get keys.
# 3) set subtraction to ignore `.`
# 4) for i in range(x), range(y) will iterate over the iterables. useful for part 2.
